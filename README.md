# Transfer-Learning-Image-Classification_Disney

This repo holds the code for a Disney-Princess-Classification Model using Transfer Learning via TensorFlow Hub modules.
The Model is deployed on Google App Engine and uses Flask as a microframework.

#### The project is for educational purposes: 
- Get to know GCP / GAE (Google App Engine)
- Get familiar with Flask
- Get familiar with GCP Cloud console or Cloud SDK
- Get familiar with TensorFlow Hub and Transfer Learning

#### Image classification problem:
Image classification is a supervised learning problem. We define a set of target classes (in our case Disney Princesses), and train a model to recognize them using labeled example photos. In our example, we will make use of TensorFlow 2.x in order to build, train, and optimize our model.
